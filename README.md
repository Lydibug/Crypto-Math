# Crypto-Math
A toy cryptographic library. 
This project is NOT guaranteed to be secure and should not be used in any projects where security is required.
Arbitrary sized number support should be implimented eventually but until then anything which requires factorization or finding roots only works with numbers up to 64 bits.
